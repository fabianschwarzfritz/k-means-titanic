## Todos
* [ ] Make output printing prettier
* [ ] Investigate: How can I find out whether some columns are already represented by other columns, so do not change the clustering? Can I find out these properties/columns and remove them?
* [ ] Refactor: Better overview int he steps conducted in the code.
* [ ] Update pip and the requirements.txt file
